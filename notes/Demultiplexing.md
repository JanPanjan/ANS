> *Multiplexing* isÂ a technique that involves combining multiple signals onto the same transmission medium to efficiently utilize the available capacity. *Demultiplexing* is undoing the multiplexing part.

Based on [[Metabarcoding#^efcd99|index sequences]] that were added during library preparation, the reads are split into separate files, one for each sample. 

> Reads that cannot be assigned are usually discarded.
