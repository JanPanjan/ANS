*rRNA or ribosomal ribonucleic acid.*

---

Ribosomes are made up of 2 subunits that were originally characterized by their *rate of sedimentation* when spun in an ultracentrifuge. 

Their names are derived from their **sedimentation coefficients** in Svedberg (S) units, which is an indication of **molecular size**.

- Bacteria
	- small subunit = 30S
	- large subunit = 50S
	- they associate to form a 70S particle
- Eucaryotic
	- small subunit = 40S
	- large subunit = 60S
	- they associate to form a 80S particle

Bacterial and eucaryotic ribosomes differ in size and composition, although the steps in the [[Proteini in peptidi|protein]] synthesis are **similar** in both. This indicates that translation is an **ancient process** that originated in their common ancestor.

On the other hand, their differences make it possible for **antibiotics** to target and inactivate **only bacterial ribosomes**.

## Variable regions of 16S rRNA

>[!abstract] Definitions
> ==Variable regions== are specific sections within a gene that show a high degree of **sequence variation** among different organisms. They make it useful for distinguishing between different species or groups of organisms and for studying their **evolutionary relationships**.
>
> ==Phylogenetic resolution== refers to the ability of a genetic marker (a variable region in this case) to **differentate** between different organisms and **accurately** reconstruct their evolutionary history.
>
> > High phy. res. $\implies$ the marker can effectively distinguish between closely related organisms and provide a detailed picture of their evolutionary branching patterns.
>
> ==Phylum== is a **major taxonomic rank** in the hierarhical classification of life, below Kingdom. Examples:
>
> - Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteriodetes within the Bacteria domain
> - Chordata within the Animalia kingdom

Variable regions are labeled V1-V9. 

Red regions have **poor phylogenetic resolution at the phylum level**.

> The ability of a genetic marker to distinguish between different phyla and accurately reflect their evolutionary relationships is poor.

Green regions on the other hand are associated with the shortest **geodesic distance**.

> Evolutionary distance between two sequences or organisms. 

These regions most likely reflect the true evolutionary path between them. Because of this, they are the **best choice for phylogeny-related analyses**.
