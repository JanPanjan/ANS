ITS is the **spacer DNA** between the small and large-subunit [rRNA](rRNA.md) genes.

> Spacer DNA is a region of non-coding DNA placed between genes (coding DNA).

In **bacteria** and **archea** there is one ITS between [[Predavanje-2#^e8946e|16S and 23S rRNA genes]]. 

In **eucaryotes** there are 2 - ITS1 between 18S and 5.8S and ITS2 between 5.8S and 28S rRNA genes.

> ITS2 originated as an insertion that interrupted the ancestral 23S rRNA gene.
