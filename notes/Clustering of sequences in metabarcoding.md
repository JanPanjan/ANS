Newer methods like DADA2 or UNOISE aim to identify *Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASV)* - error-corrected sequences. 

They are statistical models of sequencing error rates and learn from your data. This is how they can distinguish between genuine biological variants and redundant copies that occured during PCR.
