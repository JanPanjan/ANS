Instructions for filling in the worksheets:

- Worksheets include questions (some are for refreshing the knowledge, whereas some will probably require a little bit of literature review) and practical work, where you carefully insert all codes and as much as possible comments.

- Each step of the bioinformatics analysis should be well documented and explained why it was performed and why each parameter/option of the command was used.

- Bioinformatics tools which you will use have several options. I encourage you to explore why they are used for. Make sure that you add this to the report as well.

- Comments regarding the worksheets, how can be improved, what should be added, etc. are welcome.
